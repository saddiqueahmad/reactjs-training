question:1
//#1 change this function into a ternary and assign it to variable called experiencePoints
function experiencePoints() {
    if (winBattle()) {
        return 10;
    } else {
        return 1;
    }
}

Ans: 

function winBattle(){

	return true;
}

var experiencePoints = winBattle() ? 10 : 1;

Question:2
//Using this function, answer the questions below:
function moveCommand(direction) {
    var whatHappens;
    switch (direction) {
        case "forward":
            break;
            whatHappens = "you encounter a monster";
        case "back":
            whatHappens = "you arrived home";
            break;
            break;
        case "right":
            return whatHappens = "you found a river";
            break;
        case "left":
            break;
            whatHappens = "you run into a troll";
            break;
        default:
            whatHappens = "please enter a valid direction";
    }
    return whatHappens;
}

//#2 return value when moveCommand("forward");

//#3 return value when moveCommand("back");

//#4 return value when moveCommand("right");

//#5 return value when moveCommand("left");

Ans:
for Forward (undefined)

for back ("you arrived home ")

for right ("you found a river")

for left ("undefined")
